# nn-from-scratch
A Neural network for digit recognition from scratch.

I've managed to write a simple 5-layer multilayer perceptron with sigmoid activation function for recognising hand-written digits from MNIST dataset with only Numpy and Scipy

Scores:
        Train score: 0.9992044550517104 
        Test score: 0.9574074074074074

It ain't much, but it's honest work as the saying goes

Libraries: Numpy and Scipy for computations; Tqdm for a progress bar; Scikit-learn for loading the dataset, splitting the data, and using metrics

Dataset: MNIST
